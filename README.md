# Model-An-Employee

The purpose of this project was to begin to explore the concepts of object oriented programming and containment.

The source code includes 4 classes: Name, Address, Date, and Employee. The whole purpose of the Name, Address, and Date classes will be to create new objects to model an employee within the Employee class. Each containment class will have the required getter and setter methods as well as a toString() method. In the Employee class I will prompt the user to enter a number of employees to enter data for, which will create an array of said size multiplied by 4 spaces for storage of each object. I will then use a for loop to continue prompting the user to enter data for the total amount of employees and display the result at the end.
